# Dependencies

Besides what is in the Gemfile, after running `bundle install`, also install:

1. GCC 4.8.2:   *This C implementation is tested on this compiler, and not others.  I will not guarantee the correctness of this code on other compilers.*

2. SWIG:        *A tool for creating an FFI wrapper around C so that C code can be called from other languages*

**notes**: You are responsible for knowing how to install software on your own OS.  These examples are tested on Lubuntu 14.04.  Your results on other platforms may vary.
